Compiler 4650 Checkpoint #2
By: Josh Lemieux
Date: March 23rd 2015

Building and Running:
  To build this program type make when in the proper directory
  NOTE: You must have your classpath set properly in the makefile to the location of your cup.jar file!
  You can also use make clean to delete any files built during the compilation step
  To run this program type: java -classpath /NAMEOFPATH/ Scanner exfile
  To run this program in Symbol mode add -s to command
  To run this program in AST mode add -a to command
  replace NAMEOFPATH witch the location of your jar file and exfile with a example c- program

Known Limitations:

This program does not deal with compound statements inside if or while expressions
For example if you have if(x) x = 7;  This will work fine but if you have -
if(x){
x = 7;
x = x*2;
gcd();
}
This will NOT work, it will ignore all statements inside the if and contniue on

Also when printing the symbol tables out, if there are any syntax errors they will still be printed and may
even interupt the flow of how the hashtables are printed out (e.g printing errors between hashtables)

Errors:
AST errors: When an error is encountered the output will look like this - Error in line 5, column 1 : Syntax error(3)(Int)
This shows the type of error (Syntax), what caused it (a int declaration) and where its at (line 5, column 1)

Type Checking Errors: When an error is encountered the output will look like this - Line: 10, Type Error: x must be declared INT
This shows the error type, the line number, the variable that contains the error, and a little more information
